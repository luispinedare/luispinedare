## 🛡️ About Me

I'm a self-taught cybersecurity practitioner with a unique background in visual arts and data exploration. My professional path evolved from creative coding with **Arduino** and sentiment analysis in **R**, toward technical cybersecurity, automation, and network visibility.

I'm certified in **CompTIA Security+** and have built multiple labs and real-world deployments focused on **threat analysis**, **identity management**, and **infrastructure monitoring**.

- Solid understanding of **TCP/IP networking**, **OSI model**, **VLAN segmentation**, and **cybersecurity best practices**.
- Skilled in **Python scripting** for security automation and data analysis.
- Experienced with **Jupyter Notebooks** and **OpenAI APIs** for assisted, exploratory data science.
- Comfortable working across Linux, Windows, and hybrid cloud environments.
- Bilingual: **Spanish (native)** | **English (advanced technical fluency)**.
