## 🛡️ About Me

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast certified in **CompTIA Security+**, with hands-on experience deploying **SIEM** solutions (Wazuh), **NIDS** systems (OwlH), and building secure infrastructures with **pfSense**, **Proxmox**, and **Azure**.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **security**, **programming**, and **network architecture**, always seeking to improve through hands-on labs and creative projects. Recently, I’ve explored how **language models** and **prompt engineering** can support **automated data analysis**, report generation, and scripting from Jupyter Notebooks.

- Solid understanding of **TCP/IP networking**, **OSI model**, and **cybersecurity frameworks** (NIST CSF, MITRE ATT&CK, ISO 27001 - theoretical).
- Skilled in **Python scripting** for automation, threat modeling, and data workflows.
- Experience with **Cloudflare** (DNS, SSL, DDNS, Zero Trust) for homelab infrastructure.
- Bilingual: **Spanish** (native) and **English** (advanced technical proficiency).
