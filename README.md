## 🛡️ About Me

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast certified in **CompTIA Security+**, with hands-on experience deploying **SIEM** solutions (Wazuh), **NIDS** systems (OwlH), and building secure infrastructures with **pfSense** and **Azure**.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **security**, **programming**, and **network architecture**, always seeking to improve through hands-on labs and creative projects. Recently, I’ve also been exploring how **AI and language models** can support data-driven analysis in scientific and civic contexts.

- Solid understanding of **TCP/IP networking**, **OSI model**, and **cybersecurity best practices**.
- Skilled in **Python scripting** for automation, data processing, and basic security analysis.
- Proficient in **Jupyter Notebooks** for building reproducible, modular data science workflows.
- Experience using **OpenAI APIs** for exploratory data analysis and prompt-driven computation.
- Bilingual: **Spanish** (native) and **English** (advanced technical proficiency).
